    <h1>Research</h1>
    I'm interested in many different research areas, especially those with an emphasis on math and creating new
    algorithms.

    <h3>Distributed Consensus</h3>
    The new <a href="papers/2016b.pdf">hashgraph</a> consensus algorithm (illustrated with <a
        href="papers/2016b2.pdf">examples</a>) allows a group to come to agreement on an ordering for transactions, and
    to on the outcome of running code (smart contracts). It
    is Byzantine Fault Tolerant, and yields a database that is ACID compliant. Past approaches to this problem have
    included blockchain, leader-based systems, and voting-based systems. Hashgraph is different in that it ensures
    fairness of the ordering of events, and fairness in the consensus timestamps. It is more resistant to DDoS attacks
    than leader-based systems, more computationally efficient than proof-of-work blockchains, and more bandwidth
    efficient than voting-based systems. An implementation of it (with example apps) is available for download in an <a
        href="http://www.swirlds.com/download">SDK</a>.

    <h3>Jam Resistance</h3>
    Traditional jam resistant radios require some kind of secret that is shared by the sender and receiver, but unknown
    to the jammer. The <a href="papers/2007bbc2.pdf">BBC</a> system gives equally good jam resistance, but without the
    shared secret. It allows ad hoc networks to establish communication without having to share a key in advance, and
    without worrying about an attacker capturing the key. BBC is the only known system that can provide unkeyed jam
    resistance against an adversary with large amounts of computational power. When combined with the new <a
        href="papers/2012bcbs.pdf">Glowworm hash function</a>, there are both theoretical and <a
        href="papers/2015bp.pdf">empirical</a> results showing the security of the system. More recent work suggests the
    <a href="papers/2015hbt.pdf">HBT</a> system may provide a second approach to providing unkeyed jam resistance.

    <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
    The first <a href="papers/1999bm.pdf">reinforcement learning</a> algorithms with guaranteed convergence on neural
    networks, as well as the ability to optimize both value and policy functions simultaneously, rather than just using
    dynamic programming to reduce Bellman residual error. A more detailed description of these is in the <a
        href="papers/1999b.pdf">dissertation</a>. Other research includes training neural networks to <a
        href="papers/1998wbp.pdf">become more local</a> (to avoid forgetting when learning new things), generating data
    from <a href="papers/2005bsi.pdf">learned probability distributions</a>, using neural networks for <a
        href="papers/1992b.pdf">minimization</a>, new <a href="papers/1993bk3.pdf">function approximation</a> systems
    for which minimization is instantaneous, and several papers on the <a href="papers/1990wb.pdf">theory of
        reinforcement learning</a>, including theorems on <a href="papers/1993wb.pdf">actor-critic</a> and <a
        href="papers/1993wb2.pdf">value iteration</a> systems.

    <h3>Cellular Automata</h3>
    Our universe has conservation laws in physics, such as conservation of energy or conservation of angular momentum. A
    cellular automaton defines a model of a new universe with new laws of physics, which may or may not have any such
    conserved quantities. New algorithms give more efficient ways to discover whether a given cellular automaton has any
    conserved functions, and are able to <a href="papers/2007bf.pdf">discover new conserved energy functions</a> for
    many cellular automata, including where none were previously known, along with <a href="papers/2008b.pdf">proving
        they don't exist</a> in cellular automata where their existence was an open question. Furthermore, these
    functions can be simplified and better understood using an approach for factoring out "trivial" functions, which are
    functions that are conserved for all possible cellular automata. A complete <a href="papers/2012bf.pdf">theory of
        the trivials</a> was developed, and used to perform such simplifications.

    <h3>Graphics</h3>
    Computer graphics projects range from <a href="papers/2008bb2.pdf">graph drawing</a> algorithms for the Game of
    Sprouts, to <a href="papers/2006sb.pdf">visualizing cryptanalysis theorems for RC4</a>, to creating jam resistant
    codewords that <a href="papers/2010bsbs.pdf">form a picture</a>.

    <h3>Other areas</h3>
    There are a number of fun research projects, from proving the NP-completeness of the <a
        href="papers/2010bs.pdf">Game of Sprouts</a> and <a href="papers/2016fb.pdf">word hypercubes</a>, to developing
    an origami fold to turn a business card into an <a href="papers/2010bff.pdf">icosahedron</a>.
