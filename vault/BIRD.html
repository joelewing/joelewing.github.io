            <p> The Behavior Indicating Representation Description (BIRD) is unique personality test because it derives the traits for its dimensions from the feathered members of the animal kingdom. This test promises to deliver the taker with information regarding the most important information regarding their personality. Although the test may be liberating for some, and provide important insights on how to live everyday life, determining what type of bird you are will not solve all of your problems. Attempts at flight following the test are not recommended.</p><br>
<p> The first dimension aims to discover how a person relates to their environment. Some people like to constantly be exploring and discovering new territory and ideas. Others want to cultivate a few ideas and develop them to their fullest potential. People in the first category are known as Albatrosses, named after a bird that spends most of its life in continual flight. People on the other end of the spectrum are called Basketweavers, after a species of bird that spends an extensive amount of time constructing a complex, ornate nest. People who are Albatrosses are quick to learn and accept new ideas, and may accept challenges that would be pushed aside by others. However, they may come across to some people as restless and constantly unsatisfied with their lot in life. Basketweavers, though hardworking, tend to err on the side of perfectionism, and may cling to doing the same thing even if starting over would be the better option.</p><br>
<p> The second dimension describes whether a person is more likely to share or protect their resources or ideas. Cassowaries, a bird known for its infamous attacks on humans, are extremely territorial but are also very defensive and protective of their young. Penguins, on the other hand like to live in community with other penguins. When it comes to the personality types, Cassowaries make good soldiers, activists, lawyers and other positions that involve protection, they may be accused as being too aggressive. Though most people get along with Penguins, they may be accused of over-sharing on social media and not respecting other people’s boundaries.</p><br>
<p> The third dimension pertains to lifestyle. Peacocks are a bird that is known for an extravagant display of feathers, but are also associated with vanity. Robins, on the other hand seem to be content with their simpler, more practical plumage. The first type of person may be more motivated to improve their lives and to move their way up to the top, and would be viewed as being more “successful”. Despite their outward appearances, though Peacocks may find themselves unsatisfied and unfulfilled after reaching the top. Robins often find themselves contented more with less, but may miss out on opportunities due to their complacency.</p><br>
<p> The fourth dimension has to do with the development of ideas. Kookaburras are known for their talkativeness, their distinct laugh and their tendency to gather together. The Kiwi bird on the other hand prefers to live by itself, and does not like to chatter. In humans, the Kookaburra type, though friendly, may be accused as tending to hog the conversation, and trying to attract attention. The Kiwi type, though reflective, may be thought of as being shy and not appreciating the company of others.</p><br>
<p> All of these measures interpret how the individual relates to their environment and to other people. Although the assessment has the capacity for people to group themselves and understand like-minded individuals, and conversely the capacity to understand the differences that the person has from other people, the personality assessment has the same major weakness that all personality assessments share. All of the traits that were chosen for this assessment are arbitrary, and do not accurately represent the whole of a person, or a person’s actions in a given situation. Also, the BIRD assessment does not accurately represent the the changes that people go throughout life. At a stage where the person is looking at several different career options, they may find themselves as an Albatross, constantly exploring the possibilities. Once the person settles down and finds meaningful work, they may find that they are behaving more like basketweavers.</p><br>
<p> The validity of the BIRD assessment is certainly questionable. Comparing human behavior to the behavior of different species of birds functions more to assign human qualities to the birds than it does explain the behavior. Observed similarities in human behavior to birds also does not reveal what the person was thinking or feeling when they were performing that action. This test is likely to be reliable to the extent where a person would achieve the same results across multiple sittings for the assessment, but it is possible that the results could change over long periods of time as the person matures. Unless research can establish a link between these behaviors and patterns of feeling and thought that indicate actual habits, this test is unlikely to yield meaningful results.</p><br>
<p> There are other issues with this bird-brained assessment as well. Although the same could be said of other personality tests, this test in particular presents false dichotomies. The majority of people are not Cassowaries or Penguins; most people are a little bit of both at the same time. A person might be very protective of their personal property (like their home and car) but be more than willing to bring a dish to a potluck or assist an elderly neighbor as part of a community. The BIRD assessment also seems to overlap a little bit, although the focus of the category is different, in practice most Kookaburras would be Penguins as well. In conclusion, although personality tests share some common pitfalls, the BIRD assessment really is not worth squawking about.</p><br>
