            <p>Although it is a relatively rare condition, deafblindness presents unique challenges that requires special adaptations for education, life management and communication. Deafblindness refers to an individual who experiences blindness and deafness, as a result of congenital or acquired causes. Because the experiences and challenges of a person who has congenitally deafblindness differ from a person who has acquired deafblindness, these two groups are often researched separately (Dammeyer, 2014, pg. 1). Although the medical literature disagrees on the exact definition of deafblindness, the IDEA defines it as “concomitant [simultaneous] hearing and visual impairments, the combination of which causes such severe communication and other developmental and educational needs that they cannot be accommodated in special education programs solely for children with deafness or children with blindness. (“Definition of Deafblindness”)”.</p><br>
<h2 class="cool-heading-2" id="characteristics-of-deafblindness">Characteristics of Deafblindness</h2>
<p>Deafblindness is recognized as a separate disability than deafness or blindness because the loss of both vision and hearing has some unique characteristics that do not apply to either deafness or blindness. An individual who has deafness might be able to compensate through use of sight, and an individual who has vision might be able to compensate through the use of hearing. This means that deafblindness is more disabling than the combination of the two impairments (Dammeyer, 2014, pg. 1). The extent and impact of deafblindness differs from person to person. Individuals labeled as having deafblindness includes individuals who still have residual hearing or sight. Consequently, individuals can be classified along the dimensions of having acquired or congenital causes for their impairments, as well as the extent to which they have functional vision and hearing (Dammeyer, 2014, pg. 1).</p><br>
<p>These differences in ability and experiences mean that deafblindness is a very heterogenous disability group. Most people who are classified under the federal definition of deafblindness do have some functional vision or hearing (Bruce &amp; Nelson 2016). Communication is the most challenging and important area to develop appropriate interventions and accommodations for these individuals, but there is much heterogeneity between individuals that makes a tailored approach important. This approach will emphasize the individual’s strengths and address the individual’s needs (Bruce &amp; Nelson 2016).</p><br>
<h2 class="cool-heading-2" id="assessment-of-deafblindness">Assessment of Deafblindness</h2>
<p>Assessment of deafblindness will include assessments to test any remaining hearing or sight, as well as communication abilities. Different assessments are used to test the child’s ability for visual and auditory input. Assessments will also measure the child’s use of tactile input, motor output, any vocalizations to develop communication strategies. These include strategies for expressive communication, receptive communication and social interaction. Assessment is important because different children will have different ways of communicating, and is important for parents and teachers to use the child’s preferred communication method to communicate effectively (Rowland, 2009, 14-15).</p><br>
<h2 class="cool-heading-2" id="prevalence-of-deafblindness">Prevalence of Deafblindness</h2>
<p>Deafblindness, compared with the prevalence of other disabilities, is a rare condition. A report from the U.S. Department of Education found that among students between the ages of 6 and 21 receiving special education during the 2013-2014 school year, 2,924 (or 0.05% of students with disabilities as a whole) were receiving special education services (Gargiulo 13). However, The National Center on Deaf-Blindness found that this number did not include children who have deafblindness and another disability. This means that these children would have been classified under the IDEA’s Multiple Disabilities Category. In a report by The National Center on Deaf-Blindness, they found that the number of children who had received special education services for deafblindness in the U.S. between December 1, 2015 and December 1, 2016 totaled 10,749 (The National Center on Deaf-Blindness, 9). A study of the Danish population found that congenital deafblindness occurred in 1:29,000. For acquired deafblindness, it is much more likely to occur in individuals above 80 years of age (Dammeyer 2).</p><br>
<h2 class="cool-heading-2" id="etiology">Etiology</h2>
<p>There are different etiologies for congenital and acquired deafblindness. The causes for congenital deafblindness include prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal causes. Infections are one of the most common causes, such as rubella or cytomegalovirus. Low birth weight is another major etiology for congenital blindness. Meningitis, intoxication and other infections are postnatal causes. Perinatal asphyxia, Down syndrome, CHARGE syndrome, premature birth are other common causes for deafblindness (Dammeyer, 2014, p. 3).</p><br>
<p>There also many etiologies for acquired deafblindness. Usher syndrome is the cause for deafblindness in half of children and young adults. Various causes can lead to deafness, blindness or both. Diabetes can cause blindness in people of all ages. In old age, glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration lead to vision impairments. Hearing impairments can be caused noise exposure and age-related hearing loss. Tumors, head injuries, and infections can cause deafness or blindness.</p><br>
<h2 class="cool-heading-2" id="educational-and-non-educational-interventions">Educational and Non-Educational Interventions</h2>
<p>Because of the differences in their sensory capabilities, students with deafblindness require instructional differences. To accommodate their needs, there are several techniques that are used. Their deficits in their senses of vision and hearing mean that they require enhancements to visual and auditory stimuli as well as tactile stimuli (Gargiulo &amp; Bouck, 2018, p. 522). Because of the navigational and communication challenges that these students face, they may be assigned an intervener, a person who works individually with the student and helps with the student make sense of their environment, as well as assisting with communication (Gargiulo &amp; Bouck, 2018, p. 522).</p><br>
<p>In order for the student to learn effectively, they must first learn how to communicate, as well as receiving communication from teachers and parents (Gargiulo &amp; Bouck, 2018, p. 522). These methods of communication vary greatly depending on the residual vision and hearing that the student has. For students with some residual vision, techniques developed for enhancing visual stimuli for the visually impaired may be used such as large print. Many students with deafblindness rely on body movements, hand or arm gestures, or body movements in order to communicate. Some students will learn a form of sign language (Gargiulo &amp; Bouck, 2018, p. 522).</p><br>
<p>Braille is one of several tactile techniques that can be used. For example, a student could learn the alphabet through the teacher tracing the alphabet in the palm of the student’s hand. Another tactile method involves using objects associated with an activity as a symbol for that activity, such as using a spoon to represent a meal (Gargiulo &amp; Bouck, 2018, p. 522).</p><br>
