            <p>Ennui covers me<br />
                A drab vitality that won’t suffice<br />
                I don’t remember<br />
                When my mind was dancing<br />
                Into the sunset<br />
                Seems so long ago now<br />
                A big mistake<br />
                Carbon copied again and again<br />
                It’s raining inside<br />
                And when the ship crashed<br />
                Much damage<br />
                Wrenching from all continuum<br />
                Look, the time<br />
                Days fall like dominoes<br />
                Yet I remember<br />
                What a sunny day feels like<br />
                Sweet warmth<br />
                A whispering of cool breeze<br />
                It’s fiction now<br />
                Perhaps a tale told by a fool<br />
                Yet I wonder<br />
                If I could scroll back in time<br />
                Feel there<br />
                Rewind the tape and find the groove<br />
                Stay there<br />
                Is it really just a photograph?<br />
                Look, the time<br />
                Time pounced, shipwrecked<br />
                A thief in the night<br />
                A twister beneath my feet, I vanish<br />
                Into the clouds<br />
                My wings, broken, beaten, and bound<br />
                My feet, sore<br />
                And I wonder if I can take it anymore<br />
                Again and again<br />
                Drift off and wake, uncomfortable<br />
                Still confused<br />
                I’m tied up, I can hear the train<br />
                Still raining<br />
                Drab will never be enough.<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
