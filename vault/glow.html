            <p>One day, while out in the snow,</p>
            <p>beneath the white flakes, I saw a faint glow.</p>
            <p>I drew nearer to see the light,</p>
            <p>a radiance that glowed a cold yellow-white.</p>
            <p>As I picked it up in my hand,</p>
            <p>I felt as if the universe was whispering an unspoken demand.</p>
            <p>I took it inside, against my gut,</p>
            <p>Because I wished to discover its contents, containing what.</p>
            <p>I pondered, but decided not to show it to Mom,</p>
            <p>who knows, she might fear it a bomb.</p>
            <p>I left the object by my bedside that night,</p>
            <p>but woke up a few hours later in fright.</p>
            <p>A little man stood there, the strange object his source,</p>
            <p>He spoke my terrestrial English but his voice a little hoarse.</p>
            <p>Though I was big compared to his fairy small,</p>
            <p>Through his magic, I was reduced to the size of his ball.</p>
            <p>There it was, a spaceship, shining bright</p>
            <p>I was now clearly seeing what I had found earlier that night.</p>
            <p>Inviting me, to with him fly away,</p>
            <p>I was at first nervous, but then said okay.</p>
            <p>He took me on a marvelous flight,</p>
            <p>to see the wonders of the universe that night.</p>
            <p>And buried beneath the nebular snow,</p>
            <p>there was the sun of my solar system, a faint glow.</p>
