                <p>Author’s note: I have changed the crush's name to “B”. B, thank you for giving me permission to publish this.</p><br>
                <br>
                <p>    We all know that person, the one who can keep a circle of people in awe as he tells an excessively exaggerated, wild tale. I never really cared to associate with that crowd. To me, honesty is the highest form of respect, and to purposely lie? It just falls outside of what I would value as good behavior. But what if you lied to yourself? Remembering things incorrectly to fit your vision of the past just as we try to create a perfect dream of the future? And these new inventions overwrite your memories, a sort of imaginamnesia. What if even those stories you didn’t feel pressured to mistell to others were tainted by the tellings of time?</p><br>
                <p>    I have found, as a very introspective person, my memories of my own personal experiences have been tainted by a sort of incorrect telling to myself over and over again until I believe it. I find this pattern very disturbing. I’ve always considered myself to be a very honest person. I believe that honesty is the highest form of respect. Turns out that it is much easier to lie to yourself than to lie to others.</p><br>
                <p>    I think all of us use our imagination to create a future that we want, but I don’t think we realize how much we use our imaginations to shape how we view our past. Using our imagination to shape our past, we remember and view our past experiences through the lens of our present experiences. Through this comparative analysis of sorts, we start to forget how things really were. We erase the memories we don't want or need, reshape the ones we are comfortable with to a higher satisfactory state, and keep the ones we wholly love.</p><br>
                <p>    This process has become increasingly uncomfortable for me to meditate on. If people are the sum of their experiences and talents, and the former has been corrupted to fit a predefined notion, we are losing our humanity. With every attempt at remembering, with every false retelling of our stories to the crowded gossip-hungry circle of self, we are forgetting who we really are.</p><br>
                <p>    Yet our experiences, in their unaltered and true form, have immense value. Could we just lay down our pride to embrace our true selves? Many of us are already bothered by how much we put on a facade for others, but what about the masquerade we perform for ourselves? We find that we only want to remember ourselves as the hero of our story, so we re-write history to our liking. Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, and Mao Zedong also purged history to re-write it in their favor. If only we could see beneath the waters of the mind to see a mini-Hitler burning books.</p><br>
                <p>    I think all of us could probably think of something we can't remember entirely or correctly. One time, when I was at Sam's Club with my mom, we saw a car (or was it a truck?) with a bumper sticker that boldly stated “DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU THINK”. This is certainly a strange thing for a bumper sticker to say, but fortunately for us, the owner of the vehicle had just walked up. My mom inquired of what the sticker intended to say, and the man knew his facts. He responded that on a daily basis, several thousand of our thoughts are in fact incorrect. He didn’t say “several thousand”. He gave us an exact approximate number. I believe the man and his sticker, but for the life of me I could not tell the magical number of thoughts the man managed to spew out in response to our question.</p><br>
                <p>    Forgetting small details seems to be common. In a world filled with information, and millions of things screaming at all of our senses, it seems only natural that some memories would slip through the cracks. After all, who would want to remember what they ate on a precise date several years ago? The weight of all these memories would only add to the fire hose of information crushing us every day. But what about the things we do “remember”? I mean we can probably all agree that in general it is okay to forget the small, seemingly insignificant things (except on tests, right), but what about entire impressions? I find that I am guilty of this too.</p><br>
                <p>    Recently, I was sending a document to someone and accidentally sent it to Ishpreet, one of my friends in Charlottesville, Virginia where I lived almost 4 years ago. This prompted me to send an email to him apologizing for the inconvenience that I may have caused him. We had not really been in touch, but all of a sudden I found myself confronted with a world I had once known. So, in addition to the cordial apology I asked him how he was doing.</p><br>
                <p>    Then something triggered in my mind that sounded something like “THROWBACK THURSDAY!” and I remembered another friend that I had in Virginia: B. I decided to email her. She responded in her typical witty fashion. We had sent a few emails back and forth in the time since I moved to Kentucky, as well as communicating a bit with the now-dead social network, Google Buzz. Her witty ways made her almost as entertaining through email as I remembered she was in person. For some reason, though the few emails that had been sent were short and only on occasion (like on her birthday).</p><br>
                <p>    Anyhow, shortly after her reply back to my most recent email, I noticed she was online on Google Hangouts, Google's instant messaging service. Gmail's contacts side pane only displays the chat status of the contacts you were most recently messaging, and it had never crossed my mind how frequently she was online. I struck up a conversation with her, and we tried to cover how we had been lately. It was interesting hearing about what she was up to these days, the emo phase she went through and her maven-level expertise and passion for video games, computer programming (after some foolish gatekeeping, I'm afraid) and film.</p><br>
                <p>    A thought kept nagging me in the back of my head: why had I not kept in touch with B and Ishpreet and my other Charlottesville friends. I felt like I had let them down. Why had I not kept in touch?</p><br>
                <p>    Well, I had an answer for B. Or I thought I did. So, I told her, “I wanted you to find freedom in moving on”. In my mind, though we never had been dating, I remember our relationship as a typical boyfriend and girlfriend type deal. So I had avoided, for the most part, communicating with her because I thought that “moving on” was what was best for her. Turns out, I was very mistaken in evaluating what our relationship had been.</p><br>
                <p>    “Move on from what?” she responded. “Dude, nothing you're saying makes sense. I think you're overestimating some stuff.”</p><br>
                <p>    This would have been the time to say, “You know what? You're totally right, and I sound like a creep even suggesting that.” Instead, I continued to defend my position, and she continued to become more uncomfortable (as she should have been, I mean what's this guy doing coming around years later, like “Yo, are we still a thing?). I had forgotten many things from Charlottesville out of not living in that context for a long time. And, what I had remembered about my relationship with B turned out to be wrong, yet another memory tainted by the telling of time. But it's scary to think I legitimately believed this until I was corrected by B. </p><br>
                <p>    I remember when I told a similar evaluation of my relationship with B to my friend Peter.</p><br>
                <p>    His response was, “Dude, it's not what you thought it was.” He was right. B's reaction, more in touch with reality, was only to be expected. It probably wouldn't have hurt to keep in touch, (and maybe I would have learned some computer programming along the way).</p><br>
                <p>    So why hadn't I kept in touch with B and my other Charlottesville friends? I don't know for sure. Maybe I'm just a terrible friend. Maybe it was because my only internet-connected personal computing device I had for the first two years in Kentucky was a Kindle. The device had neither a keyboard or a touchscreen, and all typing was facilitated by an arrow button navigation of an onscreen keyboard. I find that the awkwardness of typing on a Kindle is somehow a good metaphor for trying to keep in touch with friends you never see. It's hard to say anything worthwhile.</p><br>
                <p>    In conclusion, don't let your mind tinker with your memories. A lot easier said than done, I know, but it's way less painful and awkward to forget things entirely, than to realize you've remembered something wrong. I really wish that I could leave the reader with some application here regarding having an untainted memory. I'm afraid I don't know what that looks like. </p><br>
                <p>    Maybe it begins with admitting that you don't have all the answers. Maybe it begins with stop viewing yourself as the hero of your story as is too often my habit. Stop trying to re-invent your life's story to match the picture-perfect story arcs in books, movies, and television. Stay close to community and your friends (even if they live far away), and invite them to fact-check you. If you don't know the answer, just admit that you don't know. </p><br>
                <p>     Believing in your own invented lies, whether by intention or by mistake often feels like freedom. After all, don't you want your life (memories and all) to fit some standard of your choosing? Thus we are lost in the land of imaginamnesia. However, there's even more freedom in being found. Only after we've been found, can we be honest with ourselves, our friends, and truly have the ability to move on with the rest of our lives. </p><br>
