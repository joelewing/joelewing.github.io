            <p> The center-stage epic hero role that Satan plays in Milton's <em>Paradise Lost</em>, has been
                controversial for centuries. In some ways, it almost looks like Milton is glorifying Satan in his
                attempt to take revenge upon God. However, as a Christian theologian, it would be unlikely that Milton
                would take this heretical view. So, the answer must be more complex.</p>
                <br>
            <p> In the writing of <em>Paradise Lost</em>, Milton sets out to create an epic written in English heroic
                verse, analogous to the Virgil's Latin <em>Aeneid</em>, and Homer's Greek <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey
                </em>(“The Verse”, <em>Paradise Lost</em>). Though attempting to emulate the works of the great
                Classics, Milton makes it clear in his call to the “heavenly muse”, the Holy Spirit, that his work will
                “soar above the Aonian mount, while it pursues things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme” (Book I, Lines
                14-16). The Holy Spirit as his guide, Milton claims that his confidence to surpass any epic poet comes
                from “thou, O Spirit that dost prefer before all temples the upright heart and pure” (Book I, Lines
                17-18).</p>
            <br>
            <p> In most traditional epics, the main character is the hero. The <em>Odyssey </em>has its Odysseus, and
                the <em>Aeneid</em> has its Aeneas. In Milton's epic, most of the time is focused around the actions of
                Satan, as he attempts to avenge God's judgment against his rebellion by thwarting the perfection of his
                creation. Instead of being portrayed as a weak, ineffective character, Satan is proud, clever, and very
                capable of leading an army. In many ways he embodies the traditional heroic ideals. Like many Greek
                heros, he is a military general.</p>
            <br>
            <p> This leads to a problem, because Satan cannot be a hero in Milton's epic if his actions and motives are
                morally bad. In a move of pride, he tries to ascend to glory equal to that of God, but he and his
                followers are cast out (Book I). Satan is also fully responsible for bringing Sin and Death into the
                world (Book II), and the fall of Man (Book IX). We are left with an evil character being portrayed as a
                hero (Murphy).</p>
             <br>   
            <p> The conflicting depiction of a bad Satan, but a good hero, has confused critics over the centuries.
                <a href="http://emergencejournal.english.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Construction-and-Rhetoric.pdf">According to Christopher Murphy</a>, a researcher at the University of California, most interpretations of
                Satan's character separate his person from his poetic construction. C.S Lewis' explanation, in his
                <em>Preface to Paradise Lost</em>, claims that Satan's actions demonstrate an ineffectiveness that
                negates his heroism. Some critics, including Stanley Fish, claim that Satan's heroism directly
                controverts his evil. Other critics will make the claim that Satan is not a hero at all, or a perversion
                of the classic hero (Murphy).</p>
            <br>
            <p> In some ways, these explanations may satisfy the awkward tension between Satan as a hero, and Satan as a
                wicked corrupter of mankind and arch enemy of God. After all, no realistic hero is without his or her
                internal conflicts. However, this does not explain Milton's choice of Satan to be the hero and main
                focus of his book. Instead of long, eloquently drawn out scenes before the throne of God, we are treated
                to long, drawn out speeches where Satan is praising himself, and gloating over victories against God
                that he is planning to win (Book I, Book II). Nowhere are there any scenes in heaven, where angels are
                flustered, dressing themselves for war. In the few scenes where we are shown God's celestial glory, God
                is discussing the danger of Satan. Nor are the other protagonists of the book, Adam and Eve, given long
                sections to air their feelings and praise God's love and the beauty of the world, or marvel upon the
                wonder of being alive.</p>
            <br>
            <p> It seems strange that Milton would choose to pick Satan as the hero and main character for a “Christian”
                epic. Could Milton's choice of Satan as a hero be a perversion of the classical epic? This explanation
                also seems to be unlikely because of Milton's almost religious attachment to the epic form in every
                other way. It seems to be then, that Milton's depiction of Satan must be allegorical in purpose.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Milton uses <em>Paradise Lost </em>as a stand for preaching many of his own personal opinions. In his
                struggles for a happy marriage, he makes the claim that women are morally lower than men, and more
                susceptible to temptation (Book IX). Milton also makes the contrary stand (for his time) against
                traditional Calvinism, refuting his peers in claiming that Man had free will. It seems that Milton's
                portrayal of Satan is an allegory, and Miltons uses the pedestal of his literary power to suggest his
                point.</p>
                <br>
            <p> From Milton's point of view, Jesus would be the real hero, but he gravitates away from the spotlight
                because He is humble. Milton demonstrates Jesus' humility when he compares the God's providing of
                clothes for Adam and Eve to Jesus' washing of his disciples feet (Lines 211-217, Book X). Because the
                Holy Spirit is “inspiring” the work, the role of God is one of humility and justice. Milton must have
                thought that Jesus didn't want to be the super-star of his work. Milton's portrayal of Satan
                figuratively represents the glory that the ancient epics tried to accomplish. Both Virgil and Homer put
                an emphasis of creating big heroes who despite the odds, managed to overcome their circumstances and
                bring glory to themselves. Milton realizes that the glory of an epic (and its heroes), even ones as
                revered as the <em>Aeneid </em>and the <em>Odyssey </em>are only temporary.</p>
            <br>
            <p> In addition to their relatively ephemeral nature, neither the pagan heroes nor the pagan authors give
                credit to where credit is due: God. Milton's reverence for Satan is a reflection of his reverence for
                the Greek epics, because the epics are great and powerful like Satan. There is nothing wrong with beauty
                and power, but if it is not used towards glorifying God, than the talents that God has gifted that
                individual have been misguided and are lost. This explains why Milton can glorify Satan with almost
                hushed tones and reverence, while at the same time, Satan is bad. Although <em>Paradise Lost</em> also
                serves as a thought-provoking illumination of the biblical narrative of Satan's fall from glory and his
                corruption of mankind, it also serves as an allegorical tragedy to those who try to accomplish things
                without God's help.</p>
            <br>
            <p> In conclusion, Milton's view of an “epic” hero is one who tries to take glory away from God. By choosing
                Satan as the protagonist, he creates the ultimate “epic” hero. However, Satan's glory, like every other
                pagan hero, is temporary. Milton realizes that the real hero, Jesus, doesn't need to glorify himself
                when all of Creation is praising him. Instead, Jesus stoops to the level of a servant to take care of
                the needs of his people. Milton demonstrates through Satan's fall, and God's compassion, that Jesus is
                the better hero.</p>
