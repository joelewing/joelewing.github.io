<p> Odysseus, the main character of Homer's <em>The Odyssey</em>, received unfair punishment and insidious manipulation from the Greek gods. There are many ways the gods had a negative effect on Odysseus' journey home from the Trojan War. Odysseus would have been much better off without the divine intervention of the gods because most of them delayed and kept Odysseus from getting home. </p><br>
<p> The Greek god of the sea, Poseidon took his rage out on Odysseus simply because Odysseus had forgotten to sacrifice to him when he had left Troy. In addition, Poseidon also answered the prayer (Book 9, Lines 585-606) of his son Polyphemus, a Cyclops who Odysseus had blinded (Book 9, Lines 429-41). Although it could be argued that Poseidon was rightfully avenging his son, if Poseidon did not want Polyphemus to be blinded by Odysseus, why did Poseidon steer Odysseus towards the land of the Cyclops? During most of the story, Odysseus is traveling through Poseidon's dominion, the sea. Poseidon never takes pity on Odysseus (Book 1, Line 24). Poseidon is one of the most powerful Greek gods, and he is bullying Odysseus.</p><br>
<p> Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, also mistreats Odysseus. Although it could be reasoned that Odysseus was actually helped by Athena, in reality Athena is taking advantage of the situation to manipulate people. Athena and the other gods should stay on their divine level instead of taking sides with the mortals. Odysseus is a very capable and wise man (Book 1, Line 79), Odysseus could very well have sailed home and defeated the suitors without divine powers aiding him. Odysseus is not a child. By helping Odysseus, Athena is using Odysseus as a pawn. If Athena wants to help Odysseus, she should do this by rallying the other gods to stop Poseidon from harming Odysseus.</p><br>
<p> At the beginning of the epic, while the gods are discussing Odysseus, Zeus falsely claims to be on Odysseus' side (Book 1, Line 75). The other Greek gods must have forgotten that Zeus was largely responsible for Odysseus' problems. At Thrinacia, the island where Helios keeps his cattle and sheep (Book 12, Line 137), the gods cast Odysseus into a deep sleep while Odysseus' starving men consume the Sungod's sacred herds. Helios then tells Zeus of this crime, and Zeus destroys Odysseus' ship, men and possessions with a lightning bolt. Odysseus almost died himself, but he manages to float to Calypso's island, where Odysseus encounters more problems. Zeus cannot claim to be Odysseus' ally, if his actions do not prove it.</p><br>
<p> Calypso is a crooked Titan daughter with the intent to physically and emotionally harm Odysseus. After Zeus destroys Odysseus' ship, Odysseus spends several days on a makeshift raft (Book 12, Line 484) before landing on the island of Ogygia. Calypso charms Odysseus with her hospitality and promise of immortality (Book 5, Line 231). This is really a façade for the true corrupt nature of Calypso. Although Calypso intends to keep Odysseus on her island forever, she does not really love her captive. If Calypso really loved Odysseus, she would have the respect to release him because Odysseus longs for his wife Penelope, and to reach home (Book 5, Line 235-247). Instead Calypso keeps Odysseus longs for his wife Penelope and to reach home (Book 5, Lines 235-247). Instead Calypso keeps Odysseus on her Island for 7 years against his will (Book 1, Line 71). Throughout his captivity on Calypso's island, Calypso is constantly manipulating Odysseus' emotions to continue an adulterous relationship (Book 5 Lines 231-236). Despite Calypso's claims (Book 5, Line 210-212) there is clearly nothing good in Calypso's heart because she refuses to release Odysseus until forced by Zeus (Book 5, Line 125).</p><br>
<p> The other Greek gods did nothing to tell their immortal family to stop messing with Odysseus. Odysseus is very important and respected even among the gods (Book 1, Line 79). Hera, the Greek goddess of marriage should want to see Odysseus and Penelope rightfully reunited. Whenever the Greek gods mess with the mortals they are manipulating people like pieces on a chess board. The Greek gods are simply too powerful. The other gods don't even seem to care that Zeus, Calypso and Poseidon are tossing around one of the greatest mortal men. When Hermes, the messenger of the gods, is delivering Zeus' message to Calypso, the first thing Hermes tells Calypso is that he was forced to run this errand (Book 5, Line 111).</p><br>
<p> Odysseus is very capable of going against most mortal powers. Odysseus is strong (Book 8, Lines 216-227) and wise. For many years Odysseus serves bravely in war, and without him the Greeks probably would not have won the war against the Trojans. Do the gods need to test Odysseus further? Odysseus is arguably the strongest person on the planet, but when Odysseus has to go against the gods themselves, Odysseus can not help but fall short for Odysseus is not a god.</p><br>
<p> "Ah, how shameless — the way these mortals blame the gods," Zeus states during the council of the gods (Book 1, Lines 37-40). "From us alone, they say, come all their miseries, yes, but they themselves, with their own reckless ways, compound their pains beyond their own proper share."</p><br>
<p>Zeus is claiming that the gods were not responsible for the sufferings of men. If one examines <em>The Odyssey</em>, this does not seem to be true at all; the gods were responsible for the absurd duration of Odysseus’ journey. Whether it was Poseidon with his undying rage against Odysseus for past afflictions, Zeus and his lightning bolt, Athena treating Odysseus like a child, or Calypso's schemes, it is not difficult to conclude that Odysseus would have been better off without the interventions of the gods. For these reasons Zeus' claim is wrong.</p><br>
