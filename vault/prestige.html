            <p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/love.html">Paul Graham's essay</a> has inspired
                me as I have thought about my career. In the context of the rest of the essay, Paul Graham defines
                prestige as what the rest of the world is telling you to become. Unfortunately, the rest of the world
                may not care about your gifts, your values and your individuality. Prestige seems to encompass
                everything that you need: a prominent place in society, honor, respect, popularity, and ultimately
                happiness. Graham is wise in asserting that our society's construct of prestige is powerful enough to
                pull you away from what you love. Even though prestige cannot really satisfy, prestige says that is
                better to be wealthy and esteemed by society than to choose a career that you truly enjoy.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Because of the allure of prestige, the original desires of the heart may become
                reprogrammed by the mind's perception of what society holds as valuable. The pull of what you actually
                enjoy gets bent by the gravity of prestige. As a consequence, the promise of a more respectable career
                or a higher paying position can lead someone away from their true passion. One might not even consider a
                unique career because it is outside of society's box. Prestige pushes people's desires beyond just
                “paying the bills” at the expense of their true passion.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Many people tell me what I “should be” or exactly what major I should choose.
                The emphasis that they place on this question can seem obsessive. I find myself asking: does happiness
                in life have to be found at the intersection of passion and money? Why do so many people dislike their
                jobs? How can I avoid the same problems? I have thought about these questions often during my high
                school years, but especially during my senior year. I have met people who have regretted their choice of
                a major, and I have met people who chose majors that didn't provide them with enough money to meet their
                expectations once they have graduated from college.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The questions involved in choosing a major and a career are many and difficult
                to answer. However, I know that there are some majors that I should not consider. For example, I have
                never had an interest in the German language or culture, so I do not want to become a German Literature
                major. Also, I dread how much our society has turned to legal processes to attack and cause conflicts,
                so I do not want to become a lawyer. In other cases, the line is more difficult to draw. My interests
                include literature and philosophy. But I am also fascinated by technology and I have always enjoyed my
                science classes. I know that engineers and computer scientists enjoy a higher standard of living than
                most liberal arts majors. Should I refrain from majoring in English just because of limited career
                prospects and money? Paul Graham would challenge me to follow my true passion. I am confident that
                Southern Mississippi will help me to resist the allure of prestige.</p>
