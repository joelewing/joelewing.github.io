            <p>These silly winds we relentlessly pursue</p>
            <p>these old things being called new</p>
            <p>we were meant to believe that this falsehood was true.</p>
            <p>But the smoke floats by</p>
            <p>not stopping, yet singing a harsh lullaby</p>
            <p>whispering old words so that we may once again try.</p>
            <p>The wheels of time turn</p>
            <p>while heaven seems contented to watch the world burn</p>
            <p>watching us forget what we were meant to learn</p>
            <p>Remember the fire from paradise that was found</p>
            <p>Anointing humanity forever on holy ground</p>
            <p>How beautiful the chains of nature’s subjection became unbound.</p>
            <p>For mankind learned to create</p>
            <p>Forever would imagination inundate</p>
            <p>Guiding humanity’s quest to reach a higher state.</p>
            <p>Now these old notions have been undone</p>
            <p>Things meant to be serious are now just silly fun</p>
            <p>Tell me, is there laughing when the world's end has begun.</p>
            <p>Convince me, where is the power </p>
            <p>Of entertainment every minute of every hour</p>
            <p>While the cove may be sweet the sea has turned sour.</p>
            <p>Once again must we pick up tools, not foolish toys</p>
            <p>Act like grown-up men, not childish boys</p>
            <p>Listen not to the wind, heed not the noise.</p>
