            <p>With a gentle pull on the string, the tiny man on the hang glider returned to the summit. From the fixed expression on his face underneath his astronaut helmet, it was difficult to tell if this pleased him. The eyes that had been watching the tiny man’s descent however, could not have been more pleased with these sounds and the scowl on the tiny man’s face. He had waited hours helping to perfect this system of LEGO bricks and string, and now, magnets. After his return to the summit, his scowl remained fixed, even as he lay in the friendly child-giant's hand. The LEGO adventurer’s descent had been beautiful, even after the hundredth time. As he rested in the giant's hand, the adventurer felt a sense of wonder towards his benevolent animator. Why had the kind child-giant spent over nine hours working on this? Elegance. Efficiency. Abstract concepts embodied at the heart of any good invention. The elegant answer was not the easiest to find. The problem seemed simple enough: he had constructed a craft made from various LEGO bricks and elements designed to zip down a length of string from a deck to the ground. That process was not too difficult to discover. The retrieval proved to be far more difficult.</p>
            <br>
<p>It was not as simple as attaching a string to the craft. With this lifeline attached, the craft’s descent was slowed to a crawl. He had tried and rejected many solutions, from pulley systems to compounding gearboxes. Hours had passed, and he seemed exhausted and about to give up. The child-giant took a deep breath, as powerful as the wind, and returned from the summit of the deck to the comfort of the couch inside.</p>
<br>
<p>When the child-giant came back outside, the tiny LEGO man heard the child-giant muttering words to himself. <em>I can't give up now, there's got to be a solution. It needs to be simple. It needs to be beautiful. It needs to be elegant.</em></p>
<br>
<p>The child-giant's eyes lit up, as if he had just been struck by an idea. <em>Magnets, that's the way. An easy way to send a craft down without too much drag, and then retrieve the craft with a separate line.</em></p>
<br>
<p>For the hundredth time, the LEGO adventurer went down the line, but this time, when he returned being pulled along by the magnetic retrieval line, the child was grinning from ear to ear. <em>The problem has been solved.</em></p>
<br>
<p>In later years, other LEGO minifigures would capture the child-giant's attention, leaving the adventurer's glory days behind as he watched the child-giant grow up from his seat on the bookshelf. As he watched the child-giant continue to solve problems through his astronaut helmet, he realized that this child-giant, unlike the ones on the other planets he had visited, had an insatiable desire to find problems, then solve them in the most elegant way possible. The LEGO adventurer had found for the first time, not just mere existence, but curious, vibrant life on another planet. </p>
